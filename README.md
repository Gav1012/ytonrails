# README

This project is a clone of Youtube covering uploading videos with thumbnails, users, like and dislike buttons, etc. \
I later want to add the ability to leave comments to further mess around with updating the db and the backend in general \
Created using Ruby on Rails to practice with a new framework for creating web applications. \
Ruby on Rails is able to handle the backend and frontend, the frontend is paired with bootstrap \
to stylize the frontend components. Future updates could include changing the layout to be more \
like Youtube and maybe including optimizing.
