# README

This project is a clone of Youtube covering uploading videos with thumbnails, users, like and dislike buttons, etc \
I later want to add the ability to leave comments to further mess around with updating the db and the backend in general \

Created using Ruby on Rails to handle all the API calls from the frontend and backend with Bootstrap to stylize components \
